# My Cart
Code for team 1306's award winning robot cart.

Includes rgb.ino which has all of the code for running the Adafruit neopixels that we put under the cart.
Also has code for controlling a victor motor controller. We planned to use this to control a CIM attached to a DART for the robot lift but instead went with relays and buttons.
